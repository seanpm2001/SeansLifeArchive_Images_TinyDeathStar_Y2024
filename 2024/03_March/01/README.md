# Tiny Death Star session

## 2024, Friday, March 1st

<!-- I had a normal length session today, doing some elevator trips, restocking, and working on some difficult assignments (assignments that take a very long time to complete, for me, this means 4 weeks or longer) I finished 1 assignment today, but also felt like the game isn't giving me money for the time I was away. I will have to check previous screenshots. !-->

I also have a plan to build all residential floor types before building other floor types (the only exception for this rule is imperial floors) I began construction on a new residential floor today, but the session went slowly, as I was dealing with the common cold during it, along with a lack of sleep. The game glitched out at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app, so I quit. - 2021 October 15th

**15**

I had a very long session again today, and made some progress. I produced some materials, did collection, restocking, tons of elevator trips, and played for nearly an hour.

I feared the game glitch that happened last week at the very end, and the elevators up button got stuck, and I couldn't get it unstuck without closing the app. It didn't reoccur today.

I didn't have any Internet at all today. The games currency store has been shut down for years, and I have found that it still attempts to connect, as when I tried to connect, it gave me an error message, rather than looping indefinitely. So it must be tied to some Wi-Fi connection type still, or that is the general message. - 2021 October 22nd

## 135

**135**

- I skipped my session this week due to a lack of time, caused by a 3rd consecutive day of difficulties waking up. Looking back, I see this as a mistake, as gameplay might have helped wake me up, or had me doing something while I was in the process of waking up, as I wasn't getting anything done regardless (I should have been doing something with my time) I will try to resume next week. - 2024, Friday, February 2nd

## Graphical notes

- Due to my screen resolution (1080x2400) there is a portion of the right of every floor that is not visible during gameplay (since day 1)
- Icons 1 and 3 of the floor `Bongos Sandwiches` heavily remind me of an old Fisher Price microwave/oven toy I used to have. I have been meaning to say this for several weeks, but I didn't know where to put it. - 2022, Friday, June 17th
- Upon building the `Technician` level (my 48th total floor, 45th when counting only non-Imperial floors, both counts include the lobby as a floor) new elements appeared on top of the death star. - 2022, Friday, July 8th 
- The gameplay images are in 1080p quality. Since this game was last updated before 2015, there is no loss in not getting images in higher quality (such as 1440p) as the game already shows that it can't adjust for my entire screen size.

## Gameplay notes

- While experimenting with quests today, I found that searching for `rebels` is not equivalent to searching for `bitizens` - 2022 July 29th
